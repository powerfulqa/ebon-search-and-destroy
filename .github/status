## Current State (2026-02-24)
Detection is fully working. Key fixes shipped:
- Passive always-on nameplate scanner (ScanTrackedNameplates) added — scans all tracked NPCs in OptionsCharacter.NPCs regardless of cache state, calls me.Button:SetNPC directly (not OnFound)
- GetPlateNameDirect() added — reads NPC name from plate:GetRegions() FontString directly, replaces broken recursive frame crawler
- npcCount < 10 guard added in PLAYER_LOGIN — forces defaults to load when saved vars are truncated (fixes stale 2-entry saved vars issue)
- me.Frame (main scan loop) is still present for TestID/namecache fallback for Outland/Northrend rares
- me.Button.HighlightedPlate nil bug fixed in _NPCScan.Button.lua
- Repo normalised: _NPCScan/ and _NPCScanOverlay/ are the only source folders
- Deploy script: tools/deploy-addons.ps1 syncs to G:\Project Ebonhold\Ebonhold\Interface\AddOns\

## Known limitations
- If saved vars grow corrupt again, delete: G:\Project Ebonhold\Ebonhold\WTF\Account\SERV\Rogue-Lite (Live)\Serv\SavedVariables\_NPCScan.lua and /reload
- Outland/Northrend detection (TestID path) not yet field-tested — needs confirmation when player travels there

## Acceptance tests passed
- Bayne (ID 1986) detected via nameplate in Eastern Kingdoms ✅
- Toast appears and NPC count loads to 89 from defaults ✅
